# AFHTTPClientLogger

AFHTTPClientLogger is a request logging extension for [AFNetworking][].  It
provides configurable HTTP request logging features on a per `AFHTTPClient`
instance basis.

It is conceptually similar to [AFHTTPRequestOperationLogger][], which works
globally across all `AFHTTPClient` instances.

## Usage

The logger is accessed via the `logger` property of an `AFHTTPClient` object
instance (simply named `client` in the examples below).  It must be explicitly
enabled:

```objective-c
client.logger.enabled = YES;
```

You can configure the log level to control the output's verbosity:

```objective-c
client.logger.level = AFHTTPClientLogLevelDebug;
```

You can also customize the output by supplying your own format blocks:

```objective-c
[client.logger setRequestStartFormatBlock:^NSString *(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, AFHTTPClientLogLevel level) {
    if (level > AFHTTPClientLogLevelInfo) {
        return nil;
    }

    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", [operation.request HTTPMethod], [[operation.request URL] absoluteString]];
}];
```
